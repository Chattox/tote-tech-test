App will take search term from user, return list of articles matching terms and display as cards.

Tapping on cards will take to full view of article (maybe straight to source URL?)

Going to use NewsAPI for this.

Default to top stories from the UK.

## To do:

- ~~Load articles from API and display as cards~~ ✔
- ~~Accept search term input from user and display matching articles~~ ✔
- ~~Pagination~~ ✔
- ~~Add on press functionality to open original article page~~ ✔
- Styling
